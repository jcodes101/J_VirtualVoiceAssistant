Elevenlabs API has a Conversation AI API that is used to make the virtual assistant

1. The API records the user's voice through microphone

2. It processes and knows when the user is done speaking or they are interrupted

3. The API makes a call to the LLM to generate a response

4. The response is synthesized into speech

5. It plays the synthesized speech through speakers


Project Overview and Capabilities:
----------------------------------
This project is a Python-based voice assistant built using the ElevenLabs Conversation AI API. Below is a summary of its main functions and capabilities:

- **Configuration & Setup:**
  - Loads API credentials (AGENT_ID, API_KEY) from a `.env` file for secure access.
  - Sets up user-specific variables (e.g., user name, schedule) and dynamically configures the agent's prompt and first message.
  - Applies a monkey-patch to the ElevenLabs `ConversationConfig` to support a custom `user_id` field.

- **Session Flow:**
  - Initializes an ElevenLabs client and configures a conversation session with custom prompts and dynamic variables.
  - Starts a voice assistant session that listens for user input via microphone, processes the input, and interacts with the LLM to generate responses.
  - Synthesizes the LLM's response into speech and plays it back to the user.

- **Callback Functions:**
  - Handles and prints the agent's responses, user transcripts, and manages interruptions (e.g., if the agent is cut off mid-response).
  - Provides clear feedback in the console for both user and agent utterances, as well as any corrections to interrupted responses.

- **Overall Capabilities:**
  - Real-time, interactive voice conversation with an AI assistant.
  - Customizable prompts and session variables for personalized experiences.
  - Robust handling of session events, including interruptions and dynamic configuration.

This setup allows for a flexible, extensible virtual assistant that can be tailored to different users and scenarios using the ElevenLabs platform.
